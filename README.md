# Weather-Based Sales Predictor

## Description
This project aims to analyze the impact of weather conditions on sales data. Using historical sales data and corresponding weather information, the project develops a predictive model to forecast future sales under varying weather conditions. This tool is particularly useful for businesses in the hospitality sector to optimize inventory and marketing strategies according to predicted weather patterns.

## Features
- **Data Analysis**: Analyze relationships between weather conditions and sales data.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Use machine learning algorithms to predict sales based on weather forecasts.
- **Backend API**: Implement a backend server for processing data and serving the predictive model's outputs.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For efficient data manipulation and numerical computations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
- **Flask**: For setting up the backend server.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For visualizing data insights.
